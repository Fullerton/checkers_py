#What do we need for this? 
#We need an a Board
#and peices

#Should we try an OO approach? where the board is an object
#the pieces should also be members of the class? or should they be their own?

#of course we need to visualize this? Any ideas? 
#No need to get fancy, I think numpy and scipy will suffice for our visualizing needs.
